title: Paleolithic Ketogenic Diet
---

This page is dedicated to showcasing English-language research and content produced by the International Center for Medical Nutritional Intervention (ICMNI) clinic in Hungary, formerly known as Paleomedicina Hungary. The Paleolithic Ketogenic Diet is trademarked by ICMNI. This website is not affiliated with ICMNI, and as such, this page should be viewed solely as an introduction to their research. You should consult with ICMNI if you have interest in PKD, to ensure that the diet is implemented according to their standards.

## ICMNI

The International Center for Medical Nutritional Intervention (ICMNI) clinic, formerly known as Paleomedicina, is based in Budapest, Hungary. Led by Dr. Zsófia Clemens and Dr. Csaba Tóth, ICMNI formulated the Paleolithic Ketogenic Diet (PKD) and have used it exclusively in their clinic since 2013 to treat an extensive range of autoimmune and metabolic diseases, such as type I diabetes, type II diabetes, cancer, and Crohn’s disease.

A primary focus of the clinic is the link between intestinal permeability and chronic health conditions. PKD was formulated as a diet shown to decrease intestinal permeability, as measured by the PEG-400 test.

## Protocol

* [“Therapeutic Protocol of Paleomedicina Hungary”](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323151200_Therapeutic_protocol_of_Paleomedicina_Hungary)
    > **Paleolithic ketogenic diet (PKD): A diet covering and limited to our
    physiological needs**  
    > We have developed the PKD in 2010-2011. Previously we have been using the paleolithic diet which proved to be ineffective in the vast majority of chronic conditions. We believe that the PKD is the only evolutionary adapted diet for humans. Rehabilitation of chronic diseases is most effective when the diet is  limited to our real physiological needs. Eating fruits and vegetables does not form part of our physiological need but are associated with risks. Plant foods can only be regarded as ”relatively” safe and only when certain plant food items are consumed and only in limited amounts. The diet was derived from clinical evidence and was not primarily influenced by archeological or ethnographic evidence, given that the application of the diet is clinical too.  Altogether clinical experience was derived from about 4000 patients.

    > **Characterizaton of the PKD**
    > * 70-100% animal based food, 0-30% plant based foods (in volume)     
    > ![](/img/wiki/pkd-characterization.jpg)                      
    > * Animal foods include red and fatty meats, fat and offal preferably from pasture-
    raised animals
    > * Fat:protein ratio about 2:1 (in grams)
    > * No nitrates, nitrites or other additives in meat products
    > * Plant foods only include fruits and ”paleolithic” vegetables from organic sources
    > * No artificial sweeteners but honey is allowed in moderation
    > * Black and herbal tea are excluded
    > * Coffee is allowed only after full regeneration and in moderation
    > * Eggs are initially excluded in those with highly elevated intestinal permeability
    and/or vaccines during the preceding 6 months

    This is a paywalled article written by Dr. Zsófia Clemens and Dr. Csaba Tóth that gives an overview of the history and practice of the paleolithic ketogenic diet. Proceeds go towards the ICNMI.

    > Developing the paleolithic ketogenic diet has been a major milestone in nutritional science; using the paleolithic ketogenic diet has enabled us to reverse chronic internal diseases that are currently regarded as incurable.
    >
    > Much has been published about healthy diets in general, however our work differs from most of these publications in that ours is based largely on clinical experience. Some of our results with the paleolithic ketogenic diet have been published at scientific forums. Moreover, our activities are not limited to clinical work only; we are also very involved in research. Much emphasis is placed on intestinal permeability, including its development and its reversal by diet.
    >
    > As you can deduce from reading the above, the paleolithic ketogenic diet follows on from the work of several eminent scientists, physicians, medical anthropologists and biologists. The highly esteemed Paleomedicina center in Hungary is where we use the paleolithic ketogenic diet as a tool of evolutionary medicine.
